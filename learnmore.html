              <p>
                There has never been an easier time to learn more about Computer Science than now. YouTube has a lot of free introductory courses from Stanford, MIT, and Harvard. In the first lectures of these courses, you will find that the instructor will give you an overview of Computer Science. 
              </p>
              <p>
                To see what people are currently talking about, you can check out news sites like MIT Technology Review and Hacker News. This is a great way to get a feel for the current discussions and topics surrounding Computer Science. 
              </p>
              <p>
                And lastly, it would be a good idea to just sit down with someone who is already knowledgeable in this subject. You can do this by contacting a Computer Science department at a college nearby and asking if you can set an appointment to speak to someone in that department. If that is not an option, you can also try to get an email contact of someone in a Computer Science department and start a dialogue through email.
